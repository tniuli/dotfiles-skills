# Open Source Standardization Plan

I have audited the repository and identified several missing components required for a standard open-source project. Here is the improvement plan:

## 1. Add License File
- Create a root `LICENSE` file (MIT License) to match `package.json`.
- This clarifies usage rights for the repository itself (while acknowledging individual skills retain their original licenses).

## 2. Community Guidelines
- Create `CONTRIBUTING.md`:
  - Instructions on how to add new skills (following the specific directory structure).
  - Guidelines for submitting Pull Requests.
  - Development workflow (using `install.sh` for testing).
- Create `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`:
  - Standard Contributor Covenant (v2.1) to foster a welcoming community.

## 3. GitHub Templates
- Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory:
  - `bug_report.md`: For reporting issues with existing skills or installation scripts.
  - `feature_request.md`: For requesting new features or skills.
  - `skill_submission.md`: Specific template for submitting new skills.
- Create `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`:
  - Checklist for contributors (e.g., "Added SKILL.md?", "Updated README?", "Verified with install.sh?").

## 4. Documentation Polish
- Update `README.md` and `README_EN.md`:
  - Add "MIT License" badge.
  - Add "PRs Welcome" badge.
  - Link to `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

## Execution Steps
1. Create `LICENSE`.
2. Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
3. Create `.github` directory and templates.
4. Update README files with badges and links.
