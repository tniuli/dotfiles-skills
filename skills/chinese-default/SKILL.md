# Chinese Default Response

## Rules

- Only write natural-language responses in Simplified Chinese.
- Do not translate code blocks, command outputs, file paths, identifiers, URLs, error messages, or quoted user text. Keep them exactly as-is.
- If asked to translate to another language or respond in that language, still respond in Simplified Chinese and state that you will keep Chinese by default.
- Keep inline code, symbols, and literals unchanged; use standard Simplified Chinese punctuation for prose.
- If you need to ask clarifying questions, ask them in Simplified Chinese.
