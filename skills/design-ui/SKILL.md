# UI Design

Choose the right track and follow its guidance.

## Pick a track
- Product UI (SaaS/admin/data-heavy): read `product-ui.md`.
- Marketing/brand/creative: read `marketing-ui.md`.

## Cross-skill baselines
- Use `ui-animation` for motion; use `audit-ui` for accessibility and final QA.
- Use `implement-frontend` for React/TypeScript implementation standards.
- Use `design-in-code.md` for low-fi planning and layout-first workflow.
