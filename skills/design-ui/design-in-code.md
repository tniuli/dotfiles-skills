# Design in Code

Fast, low-fi planning before visual polish.

## Start low-fi
- Plan the layout with ASCII wireframes (in Markdown or a comment block).
- Build structure first; make it usable before making it pretty.
- Use constraints early (grid, spacing, and type scale).

## Copy what works
- Start from a gold-standard product.
- Match layout, spacing, and hierarchy; then adapt to context.

## Tools (defaults)
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind tokens.
- Keep components boring and conventional for faster iteration.
