# Shipping Practices

Keep shipping lightweight without sacrificing safety.

## Default mode (small teams)
- Small changes, frequent merges.
- Rollback plan before you ship.
- PRs optional: use them as broadcast, not permission.

## Rollouts
- Feature flags or staged rollout when it matters.
- You might not need a staging environment.
- Prefer instant rollback over perfect pre-merge hygiene.

## Team shape
- One person owns a feature end-to-end.
- Fewer meetings, longer focus blocks.
- Define "done" before starting.

## Feedback loops
- Session replay.
- Analytics.
- Logs and metrics.
- Alerts to a shared channel.
