## Checklist
- [ ] Replace straight quotes/apostrophes with smart quotes; ensure UTF-8; normalise content at build/render time.
- [ ] Enable smart quotes; treat primes as distinct; choose dash style (spaced en or unspaced em) and be consistent.
- [ ] If em dash is too wide in the chosen face, switch to spaced en dashes for breaks.
- [ ] Use en dash for ranges and em dash for attribution; never use double hyphens; use prime/double-prime glyphs (Unicode/entities).
- [ ] Use multiplication sign and fraction entities; use accented characters correctly; avoid font subsetting; store accents as Unicode.
- [ ] Ensure fonts include accents; use correct TM/RT superscripts and copyright inline; do not duplicate word + symbol.
- [ ] Use non-breaking space between copyright symbol and year; use correct entities; use ampersands only for proper names/shorthand.
- [ ] Use ampersands sparingly; prefer midpoints for inline separators over bars/bullets.
- [ ] Use midpoints for horizontal list separators when appropriate.
- [ ] Use the correct midpoint character with hair/thin spaces as needed; remove unnecessary punctuation and follow abbreviation rules.
- [ ] Remove apostrophes from decades and periods from acronyms; choose sentence or title case for headings and apply consistently.
- [ ] Auto-format titles per style guide; enforce single space after sentence-ending punctuation.
- [ ] Audit copy for double spaces and remove them.
- [ ] Ensure all sentence-ending punctuation is followed by exactly one space.
- [ ] Use italics (not bold/all caps/quotes) for emphasis; prefer fonts with true italics for body text.
- [ ] Limit emphasis; italicize publication titles; avoid underlines except for actual links.
- [ ] Never underline for emphasis (print or web); use hanging punctuation only where feasible (blockquotes/display).
- [ ] If using hanging punctuation, implement only where support exists; for web, limit to left edge and special cases.
- [ ] Set body size first; use large desktop sizes (16-24px typical), smaller on mobile/print; adjust for x-height.
- [ ] Avoid oversized desktop type; target mobile body 15-19px and print 10-12pt; scale headers down on mobile.
- [ ] Keep line length 45-75 characters (66 ideal); adjust per breakpoint; avoid very long lines.
- [ ] Measure line length including spaces; set line height around 1.45-1.5 and avoid excessive leading; use unitless values.
- [ ] If a sans face has large x-height, add a bit more line spacing.
- [ ] Adjust line height based on size/line length/x-height; choose body fonts with low contrast, large x-height, open apertures, large counters.
- [ ] Prefer text-cut faces for body; avoid overly large x-height; select humanist/modern sans only if they meet legibility traits.
- [ ] Load real regular/italic/bold/bold-italic styles to avoid faux; define `@font-face` per weight/style.
- [ ] Ensure `@font-face` entries map the four styles to the same family with correct weights/styles.
- [ ] Prefer true italics (not obliques); use WOFF2/variable fonts; drop least-used styles only if necessary.
- [ ] Verify italics are true; use only regular/book/medium weights for body text.
- [ ] Set body weight around 400-500; avoid ultra-light weights for longform; test cross-platform.
- [ ] Use heavier weights only at large sizes; never use display faces for body copy.
- [ ] Treat Display/Headline/etc as display-only; avoid display glyphs in body; ignore Caption cuts for web body.
- [ ] Avoid long body text in monospaced fonts; reserve for short stylistic blocks.
- [ ] Allow brief mono sections only; enable standard ligatures for body; keep discretionary ligatures off in body text.
- [ ] Enable OpenType features for body: `kern`, `liga`, `clig`, `calt`.
- [ ] Disable distracting ligatures (and in code); never letterspace body text except tiny captions or display lowercase.
- [ ] Remember kerning vs letterspacing; add adequate padding/margins around paragraphs.
- [ ] Ensure column padding and outer margins (including thumb space in print and mobile gutters).
- [ ] Break long copy into readable paragraphs; avoid walls of text.
- [ ] Use subheads/lists where useful; separate paragraphs by line breaks or indents, not both.
- [ ] If using indents, apply only after the first paragraph (`p + p`) and size appropriately; keep paragraph spacing modest and responsive.
- [ ] Set line height first, then adjust paragraph spacing; avoid paragraphs touching.
- [ ] Place subheaders closer to the paragraph they introduce than to the preceding text.
- [ ] Use extra spacing for large subheaders; avoid default centre alignment except for intentional formal/large display.
- [ ] If centre-aligning text, increase line height and use sparingly.
- [ ] Avoid justified text on the web; only justify with strong hyphenation support.
- [ ] Never justify without hyphenation; avoid letterspacing in justification; use better hyphenation tools if required.
- [ ] Add letterspacing to uppercase (about 0.1-0.2em) and adjust for size.
- [ ] Increase spacing for small uppercase; avoid multi-line uppercase blocks.
- [ ] Avoid uppercase paragraphs; do not letterspace or use optical kerning on monospaced or connected script fonts.
- [ ] Keep spacing/kerning at metrics for mono/script; do not adjust tracking.
- [ ] Use metrics kerning; add slight letterspacing only for tiny text; otherwise increase font size.
- [ ] If letterspacing small text, also increase word spacing; avoid faux bold/italics by loading real styles.
- [ ] Identify true italics; avoid faux styles in output; use real small caps when available, avoid pseudo.
- [ ] Enable OpenType small caps via `font-feature-settings` and add slight tracking.
- [ ] Avoid pseudo small caps; use small caps for abbreviations/subheads; manage widows/orphans with non-breaking spaces.
- [ ] Insert non-breaking spaces in headlines/nav to prevent single-word lines; avoid overuse in paragraphs.
- [ ] Use non-breaking spaces for short phrases/time/brands; use `white-space: nowrap` sparingly; never distort type; choose condensed/extended styles.
- [ ] Do not stretch/squish body text; only distort logos if intentional; use condensed/extended variants instead.
- [ ] Use tabular figures and right alignment in tables; enable `tnum` or use mono/system fonts.
- [ ] Right-align table numbers, use commas; prefer tabular digits; use oldstyle figures in running text when available.
- [ ] Enable `onum` for oldstyle or `lnum` for lining digits; use lining next to uppercase/UI.
- [ ] Spell out 1-9 if desired; ensure text/background contrast (not necessarily pure black).
- [ ] Avoid low-contrast light text; make links distinct from body text with colour or underline.
- [ ] Implement link styling with subtle underline/hover without layout shift.
- [ ] Avoid using link colour for non-links; design accessible link styles; be cautious with text over photos.
- [ ] If using text on photos, enforce contrast (overlay or curated images) or avoid the pattern.
- [ ] Avoid decorative hero photos that hurt readability/perf; when stacking vertical type, use uppercase.
- [ ] Rotate vertical type clockwise and centre-align; rely on built-in kerning; manually kern only for large display/logos.
- [ ] Accept minor kerning irregularities; do not over-kern.
- [ ] Use metrics kerning; adjust tracking before kerning; use hair/thin spaces where needed.
- [ ] Use hair/thin spaces instead of no space or word space when spacing feels off.
- [ ] Use `&hairsp;`/`&thinsp;` around em dashes/citations as needed; add horizontal padding between nav items.
- [ ] Limit nav items; use CSS padding not spaces; indicate current nav item as selected/inactive (not others).
- [ ] Keep selected nav readable; never grey navigable items; ensure list text does not wrap under bullets.
- [ ] Use proper list markup (`<ul>/<ol>`); add vertical spacing for multi-line items.
- [ ] If list item titles wrap, increase vertical padding and tighten line height so wrapped lines stay grouped.
- [ ] Test lists with long content and narrow widths.
- [ ] Swap display faces to text faces on small screens via media queries.
- [ ] Identify display faces by naming; avoid for body; limit long light-on-dark text.
- [ ] Use off-white text on dark backgrounds; reserve reversed type for appropriate contexts.
- [ ] Edit copy for clarity; remove redundant UI text.
- [ ] Start layout with body text; use modular scale as a guide, not a constraint.
- [ ] Break the scale if optical fit demands it; prioritise readability over numeric purity.
- [ ] Choose body size first; ensure strong size contrast (same or clearly different).
- [ ] Avoid near-equal sizes; build hierarchy with weight/italics/caps/colour, one axis at a time.
- [ ] Use letterspaced caps/small caps for subheads; size caps down to avoid shouting.
- [ ] Avoid header colours that match link colours; avoid all-italic headers; use CSS text-transform; keep heading levels shallow (h1-h3).
- [ ] Use descriptive, skimmable headings (not generic).
- [ ] As headings grow, reduce weight or lighten colour for balance.
- [ ] Lighten headers subtly; prefer darkened brand hues over flat grey.
- [ ] Define and document a consistent type system; avoid random style changes; use grids but do not obsess over baseline grids.
- [ ] Baseline grids are impractical for web; prioritise font size, line height, and line length.
- [ ] Accept web fluidity; do not chase total control.
- [ ] Trust your eye; vet typography frameworks; place captions/descriptions closer to the images they describe.
- [ ] Use proximity/dividers to clarify associations; place dividers above headings, not below.
- [ ] Remember dividers are rules; avoid underlining headings; choose hanging bullets only if they improve reading.
- [ ] Decide between hanging vs indented bullets based on readability; indented often scans better.
- [ ] Avoid hanging bullets on mobile; add vertical spacing between bullet items; balance layouts optically.
- [ ] Optically centre elements (slightly above true centre); account for overshoot in round/pointed shapes.
- [ ] Limit to two typefaces (body + display) unless you can manage a complex system.
- [ ] If using more faces, enforce strict system; consider superfamilies for easy pairing.
- [ ] Prefer serif/sans pairs from the same superfamily; use example list only as a starting point.
- [ ] Avoid pairing two sans-serifs unless they are the same genre; serif + sans is safer.
- [ ] Avoid pairing two serifs; if necessary, use strong contrast or the same family.
- [ ] Avoid mixing modern and old-style serifs; pairing by the same designer can help.
- [ ] Pair typefaces that harmonize or contrast strongly; avoid "almost the same" pairs.
- [ ] Judge harmony by handwritten vs constructed feel; compare stress angles and skeletons.
- [ ] Match stress direction to find harmony (e.g., vertical stress pairs).
- [ ] Geometric sans pairs well with modern/rational serifs; ensure text legibility at small sizes.
- [ ] Avoid geometric sans with old-style serif; pair grotesques/gothics with transitional serifs for classic feel.
- [ ] Understand grotesque/grotesk/gothic naming; pair neo-grotesques with slab serifs.
- [ ] Neo-grotesques are weak for body; slabs can be good; pair humanist sans with old-style serifs.
- [ ] Humanist serif/sans share calligraphic traits; pair neo-humanist sans with contemporary serifs for screens.
- [ ] Neo-humanist + contemporary serif are highly readable; treat pairing rules as guidance, not law.
- [ ] Know rules before breaking them; pick UI fonts with distinct l/I/1 glyphs.
- [ ] Check ambiguous glyphs (I/l/1); consider serifs for UI; use condensed faces for headlines when space is tight.
- [ ] Use condensed/extra-condensed for headlines to control line breaks; avoid condensed for body.
- [ ] Condensed faces can work for tight UI labels; when swapping fonts, re-tune size/line/spacing/padding.
- [ ] If fonts are metrically compatible, swaps are easier; define strong fallback font stacks.
- [ ] Test fallbacks and missing glyphs; ensure accent support; avoid empty glyph boxes.
- [ ] Include likely-installed fallbacks; avoid over-subsetting; choose quality fonts.
- [ ] Evaluate font quality via kerning/word samples; prefer reputable sources; do not use pirated fonts.
- [ ] License fonts properly (especially web); buy full families or use open-source; use large type as a design element.
- [ ] Use huge type to showcase fonts; scale down on small screens; begin brand capitalization decisions.
- [ ] Pick a consistent brand capitalization (prefer single-word with initial cap); avoid all caps/lowercase in running text.
- [ ] Avoid .com in brand names; use mid-word caps only if needed; enforce consistency everywhere.
- [ ] Choose logo typeface based on the specific letters in the name; favor distinctive glyphs you actually use.
- [ ] Use swashes/discretionary ligatures/stylistic alternates in logos sparingly for memorability.
- [ ] Look for swashes in italics or separate files; use display cut for headlines when available.
- [ ] Use display cuts only at large sizes; enable discretionary ligatures/swashes for headlines, not body.
- [ ] Enable headline OpenType features: `kern`, `liga`, `clig`, `calt`, `dlig`, `swsh`.
- [ ] Enable swashes on specific letters if needed; tighten line height and tracking for large headlines.
- [ ] Use negative leading only when safe; test multi-line headlines; display cuts may need less tracking.
- [ ] Break the grid intentionally with oversized type/images/quotes while keeping overall structure.
- [ ] Allow grid deviations when useful; add a lead/lede paragraph with larger or distinct styling.
- [ ] Leads can be short; start articles with initial small caps or drop caps where appropriate.
- [ ] Implement small caps or drop caps (CSS `initial-letter` in Safari or JS fallback); use whitespace as a design element.
- [ ] Give typography room to breathe; use colour to create brand and hierarchy.
- [ ] Use colour intentionally with sufficient contrast; subtle tints can be distinctive.
- [ ] Avoid pure black/white; use slightly tinted blacks/whites to reduce glare.
- [ ] Tint blacks/whites with brand hue but keep contrast adequate.
- [ ] Keep type consistent across web/print/app; license fonts for each medium; make body text distinctive to brand.
- [ ] Experiment beyond default fonts/colours; aim for recognisable body-text identity.
